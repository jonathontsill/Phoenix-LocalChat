# Jon's LocalChat

## Overview

Using the Phoenix boilerplate, I created a backend Phoenix realtime messaging app that allows local users to communicate back and forth with each other inside different instances of [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) using it's built-in channels and socketing handling.

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
